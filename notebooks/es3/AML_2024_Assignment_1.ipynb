        "You can retrain and improve the base model, and you will obtain better results; however, **you are not graded based on the performance reached** by your model (so don't overuse the GPU to gain a 1% more in accuracy).\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Train the unsupervised model with Barlow Twins. Take the representations learned using Barlow Twins for all. Remember to use the base model output and not the projection head. The space plotted in the hands-on comes from the projection head.\n",
